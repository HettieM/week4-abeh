## Install 
To install the project: 
1. Clone the project
2. Run ```npm install``` to setup package dependencies
3. Install tape with ```npm i -D tape
4. Run ```npm test```

## DAY 1
- Thought it was a good idea to group mob the ⚠️ WHOLE ⚠️ server:
 <!-- Tom: "Yeah we can knock that out in 15"
 Rest: "yeah mate yeah" -->
- SO, we got frazzled.

## DAY 2
- Finished off the server and wisely split into pairs
- Worked on refactoring the server and tests
- In the afternoon we focused on CSS and Heroku



### User stories 
- [x] A page with a form to submit posts, and a page showing all posts
- [x] All static assets served correctly
- [x] Tests for each server route
- [] Responsive, mobile-first design
- [] Ensure your app is accessible to as many different users as possible
- [] *Stretch goal*: As an impulsive person, I want to delete my posts so nobody can see them anymore 


### Struggles
- Group mobbing - mob mentality 
- Test redirects


### Success'
- Applying workshops to real life examples
