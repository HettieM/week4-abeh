# Week4-abeh - Microblogging Project :hamburger:

## Description
Microblogging website using a server.

## Install 
To install the project: 
1. Clone the project
2. Run ```npm install``` to setup package dependencies
3. Install tape with ```npm i -D tape```
4. Run ```npm test```

## DAY 1
- Thought it was a good idea to group mob the ⚠️ WHOLE ⚠️ server:
- Optimist: "Yeah we can knock that out in 15"
 Rest: "yeah mate yeah"
- SO, we got frazzled.

## DAY 2
- Finished off the server and wisely split into pairs
- Worked on refactoring the server and tests
- In the afternoon we focused on CSS and Heroku

## Methodology & Planning
### Wireframe

### Testing methodology
Testing, testing 123.

## Core User Stories
- [x] A page with a form to submit posts, and a page showing all posts
- [x] All static assets served correctly
- [x] Tests for each server route
- [X] Responsive, mobile-first design
- [] Ensure your app is accessible to as many different users as possible
- [] *Stretch goal*: As an impulsive person, I want to delete my posts so nobody can see them anymore
